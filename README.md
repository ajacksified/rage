rage
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'rate' with 'rage' in easypost.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/ajacksified/rage/blob/master/Rage.crx?raw=true)

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions or go to chrome://extensions. Select Developer Mode.
[Chrome 63 is broken](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=794219), so "load unpacked extension" and select the src folder. Someday we may just be able to drag Rage.crx. :sparkles:
